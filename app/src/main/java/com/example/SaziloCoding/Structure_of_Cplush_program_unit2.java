In Figure, the iostream header is used. When the compiler processes the instruction #include<iostream>, it includes the contents of the stream in the program. This enables the programmer to use standard input, output, and error facilities that are provided only through the standard streams defined in <iostream>. These standard streams process data as a stream of characters, that is, data is read and displayed in a continuous flow.
