He wanted to put together the quickness of BCPL, the high-level of Simula, and the universality of Dennis Ritchieâ€™s C. He took inspiration from other languages as well, such as Ada, ML, and ALGOL 68, to create a well-structured, general-purpose language that could compile nearly all C programs without changing their source code. C++ is so flexible that is often nicknamed the \"Swiss Pocket Knife of Programming Languages\" (although this nickname is shared by Python as well).");

Prior to the advent of object-oriented programming, programmers typically saw a codebase as composed of individual command line instructions. The identification of objects with data and functions built in led to a new way of packaging and automating code work.");
